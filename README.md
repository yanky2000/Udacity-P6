## Questions:

<!-- How to reference filtered array of locations created in ViewModel from map-data.js -->

<!-- Confused about how to 'glue' google map code with ko.observableArray. What is the actual scoping architecture, when my app runs? Specifically, global vars in app.js and map.js? How window. relates to it?

Do I need convert array of initial data to observableArray?
Is it neccessary because of future localStorage or Firebase issues? -->
