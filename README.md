# If you ever come to Moscow...

This app is about places I found interesting in Moscow. 

## Launch

To start using it, just open index.html file in your browser. No server is required.

Locations you'll see on this map are synced with Firebase cloud and get updated every time you launch the app. I promise I'll keep adding new places in the future, so make sure you give it another try and check out new cool stuff here!
