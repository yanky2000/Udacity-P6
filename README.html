<p>Confused about how to &#39;glue&#39; google map code with ko.observableArray. What is the actual scoping architecture, when my app runs? Specifically, global vars in app.js and map.js? How window. relates to it?</p>
<p>Do I need convert array of initial data to observableArray? 
Is it neccessary because of future localStorage or Firebase issues?</p>
